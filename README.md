# zoomable_sunburst

This project aims to visualize species tables produced by eDNA analysis in Zoomable sunburst visulization in D3

It draws from: 

Mike Bostock's [D3 Zoomable Sunburst example](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/d3-zoomable-sunburst)

with D3 v5 (based on the [changes in v5](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-in-d3-50))

  Ported from [this Observable notebook](https://beta.observablehq.com/@tasqon/d3-circle-packing) for [this](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/notebook-to-vanilla-javascript-steps/1644/5) forum thread. Many thanks to Bryan Gingechen who answered my question about the necessary steps to get from an (Observable) JavaScript notebook to a vanilla JavaScript index.html. He presented his solution on [blockbuilder.org](https://blockbuilder.org/bryangingechen/ffd619bb5889d146fe6c5d581d3ea00e)
